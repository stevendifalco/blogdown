My research project involved a survey mailed to residents of Connecticut, to understand public perceptions and opinons towards tree management. I used spatial analysis to evaluate how attitudes vary spatially. I am interested in the interaction between humans and natural resources, and how this shapes their approval of management decisions. While at UConn, I have honed my skills in ArcGIS/ArcOnline and developed an understanding of statistical softwares such as R, Python, and SPSS.\nFor five years, I worked as a natural resource specialist to restore native ecosystems through invasive plant management. I focused on restoring forests and fields to their native composition. I collected and propogated native plants to aid in this process, and return locally extripated species. I am interested in the way exotic invasive species affect local ecosystems, and best management practices to mitigate their impacts. One of the most important parts of land management is the reestablishment of native plant populations. Restoring and maintaining native plant populations is important for helping provide habitat for our native pollinators\n Interview with Naturally@UConn\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://stevendifalco.com/author/steven-difalco/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/steven-difalco/","section":"authors","summary":"I am currently pursuing a master’s degree in Natural Resources at the University of Connecticut, where I am studying the human dimensions of roadside vegetation management.

Mansfield Town Trails and Protected Open Space 2) iNaturalist data analysis in R I am interested in using iNaturalist data to understand distribution of species and what species are being represented by citizen scientists. There is an overwhelming amount of data collected everyday. Learning ways to utilize this data is important. I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on different ways to visualize iNat observations. Below are some preliminary results. I would like to understand if invasive species or native species are posted more often and where these observations occur; are there more observations near homes or protected lands? how far off trail do people go to make observations? Top 30 most common plants Top 30 most common observations for 10 years of iNaturalist data, separated by native and invasive. It appears that many of top observed plants are abundant species throughout most of Connecticut and mostly deer-resistant species. Native vs Invasive Observations occured throughout most of the state during this 10 year period, with no apparent trend yet of invasive vs native plants. Of interest to me is the abundance of observations around specific areas, such as the UConn campus in the northeastern part of the state.
